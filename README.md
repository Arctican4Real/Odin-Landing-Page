# Odin-Landing-Page
Second big project for "The Odin Project" course. This is a full fledged css landing page.

After 3 hours of coding, I'm done! There's still a bit of polishing up to do, but I really like how it turned out!
Super fun to make, and was great practice!

Thanks to my mom for the name idea! (It's Bangla for Fresh)

And of course, thank you to stackoverflow, W3schools and all the other websites!
